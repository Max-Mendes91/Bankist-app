## Overview
This is a simple bank app built as part of **The Complete JavaScript Course 2025** by **Jonas Schmedtmann**. Features include:

- Login with username and PIN
- View account movements (deposits & withdrawals)
- Transfer money between accounts
- Request a loan
- Close an account
- Logout timer
- Movement dates formatted relative to today (Today, Yesterday, X days ago)
- Currency formatting based on locale

## Account Access
The usernames and PINs for testing the app are included in the JavaScript file (`script.js`). You can use them to log in and try out the features of the app.

## What I Learned
- JavaScript fundamentals (arrays, objects, functions)
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Working with dates, numbers, and internationalization (Intl API)
- UI updates based on user actions

## Notes
- This project uses hardcoded accounts; no backend or database.
- Built by coding along with the instructor **Jonas Schmedtmann** for learning purposes.
